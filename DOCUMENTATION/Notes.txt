Script can be run in ArcGIS Pro via 'LegalDescriptionToolbox' or run legal_description_to_feature_v2.py as a stand-alone script in VSCode.


LD_Toolbox folder - Contains the toolbox scripts
 - All the scripts in this folder need to be within the same folder


Monthly Lease Update.gdb - Contains the GIS Lease Layer you will be targeting. 
- In the documentation and scripts, this lease layer is refered to as the 'GIS Layer'
- Schema of this Lease Layer must match what is within the 'config.py' script. If it is not matching the script will fail. It is ok
to change the schema as long as this script matches the field names within the Lease Layer.

- The script first parses through the attributes within the GIS Lease Layer and updates them based on the excel spreadsheet you pull from Netsuite.
This parse is based on the Lease Transaction Number field. If it does not find a Transaction Number that is within the excel spreadsheet, but not in the Lease Layer,
it will move on to the next part of the script and create the polygon.
